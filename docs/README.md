# OctoAcme Project Management Process Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the project management processes used by OctoAcme, guiding teams from project initiation through delivery, release, and continuous improvement.

## Key Workflows

OctoAcme structures projects into clear phases: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Projects start with validating business needs and defining key success metrics in a Project One-pager. The planning phase involves creating a prioritized backlog, estimating scope, clarifying dependencies, and aligning on milestones. Execution is managed through project boards with standardized columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done), disciplined pull request workflows, and regular team rituals (daily standups, weekly syncs, demos).

## Personas and Roles

Core roles include the Project Manager (coordinating delivery, risk, and communication), Product Manager (defining vision, prioritizing the backlog), Developers (implementing and testing features), QA/Testers (validating quality), and Stakeholders (providing input and approvals). Each role has clear responsibilities and goals, ensuring accountability and effective collaboration.

## Communication Strategies

OctoAcme emphasizes transparency and alignment through weekly PM/Product syncs, regular team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risks and dependencies are tracked in a risk register and regularly reviewed. Communication templates standardize status updates, incident responses, and escalation paths, ensuring clarity across all teams and stakeholders.

## Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is built into every stage: automated and manual testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), security scans, and manual QA for releases. Releases follow a structured checklist with pre-release criteria, deployment protocols, and rollback plans. Continuous improvement is driven by regular retrospectives, tracking action items and measuring their impact to foster a culture of learning and adaptation.
